# Practice C++ Code

This files in this folder were written by me for language practice. Problems were given by Hackerrank and Leetcode.

They were tested on Ubuntu 18.04 Linux OS. Written using Visual Studio Code.

## To run:

1. Make sure gcc is is installed
```bash
gcc -v
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential gdb
```
2. In Visual Studio choose Terminal > Configure Default Build Task. A dropdown appears showing various predefined build tasks for C++ compilers. Choose C/C++: g++ build active file. This will create a tasks.json file in a .vscode folder and open it in the editor.

3. Go back to the file you want to run. To run the build task defined in tasks.json, press Ctrl+Shift+B or from the Terminal main menu choose Run Build Task.

4. In command line run:
```bash
./filename
```
